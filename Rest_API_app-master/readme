# Sports App API

This project is a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express, designed to manage competitions in a sports application. The app interacts with a MongoDB database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on competition data. The data is stored in a MongoDB collection, allowing for easy access, modification, and removal of competition records.

## Features

- **GET /api/competitions** - Retrieve a list of all competitions.
- **GET /api/competitions/:id** - Retrieve a specific competition by its ID.
- **POST /api/competitions** - Add a new competition.
- **PUT /api/competitions/:id** - Update an existing competition by its ID.
- **DELETE /api/competitions/:id** - Remove a competition by its ID.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the server-side.
- **Express**: Web framework for building the RESTful API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing competition data.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud-based MongoDB service to host the database.
- **dotenv**: To manage environment variables like MongoDB credentials securely.
- **body-parser**: To parse incoming request bodies in middleware.
